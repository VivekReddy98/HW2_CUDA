# CUDA Assignment 
Assigment Completed as a part of CSC 548 Paralell Systems at NC State University.


## Task 1: Indefinite Integration of a 1D sine function using CUDA.
1) Approach is specified in the p2.README file.

## Task 2: Accelerating 2D Ripple Propagation Simulation using Parallel Programming (CUDA & MPI)
1) Converted 5pt Stencil to 13pt Stencil Evolve function to provide faster convergence of the Ripple.
2) Implemented CUDA only variant and tested for various GRID sizes
3) Implemented CUDA-MPI variant and tested for various GRID sizes on four diffent nodes, with different memory address spaces.
4) Performance comparison and the implementational nuances are specified in p3.README.
